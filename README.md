Sudoku Pi is a finger-friendly Sudoku game that takes a refreshing new approach
to how the game is played. Our aim is to minimize finger movements and to
prevent mistakes.

- Select numbers using a circular wheel.
- Numbers that cannot be filled in are disabled in the wheel by default.
- Effective note taking: Quickly "draw" multiple notes in a single movement.
- Select one of five difficulty levels.
- Highscore screen with random fortune quotes.
- No ads, forever.
