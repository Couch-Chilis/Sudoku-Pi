# Sudoku Pi

> Your new way to play Sudoku

Sudoku Pi is a finger-friendly Sudoku game that takes a refreshing new approach
to how the game is played. Our aim is to minimize finger movements and to
prevent mistakes.

- Select numbers using a circular wheel.
- Numbers that cannot be filled in are disabled in the wheel by default.
- Effective note taking: Quickly "draw" multiple notes in a single movement.
- Select one of five difficulty levels.
- Highscore screen with random fortune quotes.
- No ads, forever.

Sudoku Pi is currently in BETA and free to download. Starting in January, it
will become a paid app in the App Store, but beta testers will keep free access
forever.

In addition, this source code repository provides free access to Sudoku Pi under
an open-source license that grants you the right to make copies and make
modifications, so long as your copies are made available under the same terms.
